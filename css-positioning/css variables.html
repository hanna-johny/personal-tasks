        <p>Players control Mario, or his brother Luigi in the multiplayer mode, as they traverse the Mushroom Kingdom to rescue Princess Toadstool from King Koopa (later named Bowser). They traverse side-scrolling stages while avoiding hazards such as enemies and pits with the aid of power-ups such as the Super Mushroom, Fire Flower, and Starman.</p>

            <h2>In Fact, We're Piping-Mad</h2>
            <p>Super Mario Bros. is frequently cited as one of the greatest video games of all time, and is particularly admired for its precise controls. It has been re-released on most Nintendo systems, and is one of the bestselling games of all time, with more than 58 million copies sold worldwide. It is credited alongside the NES as one of the key factors in reviving the video game industry after the 1983 crash, and helped popularize the side-scrolling platform game genre. </p>

        <h2>No Job is Too Big</h2>
        <p>In early 2003, Super Mario Bros. was ported to the Game Boy Advance as a part of the Famicom Minis collection in Japan and as a part of the NES Series in the US. This version of the game is emulated, identical to the original game. According to the NPD Group (which tracks game sales in North America), this became the bestselling Game Boy Advance game from June 2004 to December 2004.[86] In 2005, Nintendo re-released this port of the game as a part of the game's 20th Anniversary; this special edition of the game went on to sell approximately 876,000 units.[86]</p>

                <p>Super Mario Bros. is one of the 30 games included with the NES Classic Edition, a dedicated video game console.[88] This version of the game allows for the use of suspension points to save in-game progress, and can be played in various different display styles, including its original 4:3 resolution, a "pixel-perfect" resolution and a style emulating the look of a cathode ray tube television.[19]

                    In November 2020, a new version of the Game & Watch: Super Mario Bros. was released, which features the original NES version of the game with some modifications. It starts with the A button, adds the "unlocking" of hard mode after completing the normal game (which was originally lost when the NES is turned off), adds a level select option if the B button is pressed at the title screen,[89] and adds an "infinite Mario" mode which starts the game with unlimited lives if the A button is held at the title screen.[90]

                        <p>Super Mario Bros. was immensely successful, both commercially and critically. It helped popularize the side-scrolling platform game genre,[100] and served as a killer app for the NES.[101][95] Upon release in Japan, 1.2 million copies were sold during its September 1985 release month.[39] Within four months, about 3 million copies were sold in Japan,[102][103] grossing more than Â¥12.2 billion, equivalent to $72 million at the time[104] (which is inflation-adjusted to $196 million in 2022). The success of Super Mario Bros. helped increase Famicom sales to 6.2 million units by January 1986.</p>

                            <p>Super Mario Bros. has been re-released for several of Nintendo's game systems as a part of their Virtual Console line of classic video game releases. It was first released for the Wii on December 2, 2006, in Japan, December 25, 2006, in North America and January 5, 2007, in PAL regions. The release is a complete emulation of the original game, meaning that nothing is changed from its original NES release.[91][92] This version of the game is also one of the "trial games" made available in the "Masterpieces" section in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, where it can be demoed for a limited amount of time.[93] A Nintendo 3DS release of the game was initially distributed exclusively to members of Nintendo's 3DS Ambassador Program in September 2011. A general release of the game later came through in Japan on January 5, 2012, in North America on February 16, 2012, and in Europe on March 1, 2012. The game was released for the Wii U's Virtual Console in Japan on June 5, 2013, followed by Europe on September 12, 2013, and North America on September 19, 2013.[94]
