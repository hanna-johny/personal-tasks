    <p>The launcher identified for Chandrayaan-3 is LVM3 M4 which will place the integrated module in an Elliptic Parking Orbit (EPO) of size ~170 x 36500 km. The mission objectives of Chandrayaan-3 are: To demonstrate Safe and Soft Landing on Lunar Surface. To demonstrate Rover roving on the moon and.On 3 September, the rover was put into sleep mode after it had completed all of its assignments. Its batteries were charged and receiver left on, according to ISRO, in preparation for the impending lunar night.[58] "The rover's payloads are turned off and the data it collected has been transmitted to Earth via the lander", the statement said. Chandrayaan-3's lander and rover were expected to operate only for one lunar daylight period, or 14 Earth days, and the on-board electronics were not designed to withstand the −120 °C (−184 °F) nighttime temperatures on the Moon.[59] If the rover and lander were to survive the lunar night, the mission is planned to be extended for further science operations.

        Vikram fired its engines for a brief 'hop' on the lunar surface on 3 September, ascending 40 cm (16 in) off the lunar surface and translating a similar distance laterally across the surface. The test demonstrated capabilities to be used in potential future sample return missions. The instruments and rover deployment ramp were retracted for the hop and redeployed afterwards.</p>

        <p>On 29 August, ISRO reported that the laser-induced breakdown spectroscope (LIBS) instrument onboard the Pragyan rover has "unambiguously" confirmed the presence of sulfur in the lunar surface near the south pole, through "first-ever in-situ measurements".[77][78] The presence of sulfur on the Moon has been known before;[79] however, it was detected for the first time at the south pole by the rover.[80]

            Noah Petro, a project scientist at NASA, while speaking to the BBC, stated that while sulfur has been known to be in the lunar regolith from Apollo program samples, he described Pragyan's findings as a "tremendous accomplishment".[81]
            
            Apart from sulfur, the rover also detected other elements including aluminium (Al), calcium (Ca), iron (Fe), chromium (Cr), titanium (Ti), manganese (Mn), silicon (Si), and oxygen (O).[82] The agency said it is also searching for hydrogen (H).[83][84]</p>

            <p>Chandrayaan-3's landing live stream on ISRO's official YouTube channel received eight million concurrent viewers,[87] which is the highest in YouTube's history.[88][89]

                Congratulating the ISRO team behind the successful Chandrayaan-3 mission at ISRO Telemetry, Tracking and Command Network in Bengaluru, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the touchdown point of the Vikram lander would henceforth be known as Shiv Shakti point.[90] He further declared 23 August, the day the Vikram lander landed on the Moon, as National Space Day.[91][92]
                
                ISRO chief S. Somanath exclaimed "India is on the Moon" after the successful touchdown.[93] "We learnt a lot from our failure and corrected it. It's now 14 days of work and we have to conduct experiments," he told India Today.[94]
                
                P Veeramuthuvel, the Project Director of the mission said, "It's a great moment of happiness. On behalf of the team it gives me immense satisfaction on achieving this goal as the Project Director of the mission. The entire mission operations right from launch till landing happened flawlessly as per the timeline".[95] S. Mohana Kumar, the Mission Director, said that Chandrayaan-3 was a "team effort".[96]
                
                Meanwhile, former ISRO chief K Sivan, under whose tenure the Chandrayaan-2 was launched said, "We are really excited to see this grand success. For this, we have been waiting for the last four years. This success is sweet news for us and for the entire nation."[97]
                
                DY Chandrachud, the Chief Justice of India hailed the landing as "a milestone in the onward march of our nation" and congratulated the ISRO team.[98]
