        <h2>It's a me, Mario</h2>
        <p>Nature provides us with many resources, and we return its kindness by overexploiting and harming nature. Thus, as people living on Earth, we need to be conscious of our actions on surroundings that disrupt its natural flow. Human activities are the main villain that harms nature.The fact is that these crises are all interlinked. They impinge on the rights and the quality of life of billions of people today and in the future – especially the most vulnerable.

            And nature is a big part of the solution. These integrated crises demand integrated solutions – and the solutions to all are fundamentally dependent on a functioning environment. Threats to nature are an existential risk to human survival.

    <p>Despite global agreements, biodiversity and nature loss is accelerating in all regions of the world. We are experiencing a dangerous decline in nature, and humans are causing it.

        From population increase to overconsumption to land clearance for agriculture, the threats to our natural environment are dangerous and ongoing. Over the past 50 years, nature has declined more extensively than at any other time in human history, while global warming patterns continue to accelerate.
        
        We are destabilizing the planet.
